# LinearRegression-HousingPrices
A ML Linear Regression model to predict house prices.

# House Price Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project that predicts house prices based on various features using a linear regression model. The dataset used for this project is `Housing.csv`.

## Features

- Calculation of mean house price.
- Training a linear regression model to predict house prices.
- Functions to predict house prices given input features.

## Files in the Repository

- `data_processing.py`: Contains functions to load and preprocess the dataset.
- `model.py`: Contains functions related to training the linear regression model, saving/loading the model, and making predictions.
- `test_model.py`: Contains unit tests for the functions in `model.py`.
-  'Housing.csv' -contains the dataset used for this project.
-  'requirements.txt' Contains the names of packages used.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have all the required packages installed. See requirements.txt 
2. Run the tests to ensure everything is working correctly: python test_model.py
3. Use the functions from `data_processing.py` and `model.py` in your projects as needed.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is `Housing.csv`. It contains various features of houses and their corresponding prices.
